This is a pre-trained English language model for the winkjs NLP package — [Wink NLP](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/). The lite model package has a size of under 800KB, which expands to about 2.4MB after installation. It contains models for the following NLP tasks:

1. Tokenization
2. Token's Feature Extraction
3. Sentence Boundary Detection
4. Negation Handling
5. POS tagging
6. Lemmatization (upcoming)
7. Named Entity Recognition
8. Sentiment Analysis
9. Custom Entities Definition



### Getting Started

#### Installation
The model must be installed along with the [wink-nlp](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/):

```sh
# Install wink-nlp
npm install wink-nlp --save
# Install wink-eng-lite-model
node -e "require( 'wink-nlp/models/install' )" wink-eng-lite-model
```

#### Example
We start by requiring the **wink-nlp** package and the **wink-eng-lite-model**. Then we instantiate wink-nlp using the language model:

```javascript
// Load "wink-nlp" package.
const winkNLP = require('wink-nlp');
// Load english language model — light version.
const model = require('wink-eng-lite-model');
// Instantiate wink-nlp.
const nlp = winkNLP(model);

// Code for Hello World!
var text = 'Hello   World!';
var doc = nlp.readDoc(text);
console.log(doc.out());
// -> Hello   World!
```
