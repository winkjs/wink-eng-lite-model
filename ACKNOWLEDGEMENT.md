# Wordnet 3.0

WordNet® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser(link is external). WordNet is also freely and publicly available for download. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.

# fnTBL
fnTBL is a customizable, portable and free source machine-learning toolkit primarily oriented towards Natural Language-releated tasks (POS tagging, base NP chunking, text chunking, EOS detection, word sense disambiguation). It can handle reasonably sized, discrete classification task (i.e. the samples can be characterized as vectors with discrete components).

# ML-SentiCon
This resource contains lemma-level sentiment lexicons at lemma level for English, Spanish, Catalan, Basque and Galician. For each lemma, it provides an estimation of polarity (from very negative -1.0 to very positive +1.0), and a standard deviation (related with ambiguity of the polarity estimation, please refer to paper for further details).

These lexicons are layered, allowing to trade off between the amount of available words and the accuracy of the estimations. The lexicons have been automatically generated from an improved version of SentiWordNet, a very popular resource which contains estimations of the positivity and negativity of synsets. The resource containing all the lexicons, ML-SentiCon, is publicly available. © 2014 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.

# Emoji Sentiment Ranking
A lexicon of 751 emoji characters with automatically assigned sentiment. The sentiment is computed from 70,000 tweets, labeled by 83 human annotators in 13 European languages. The process and analysis of emoji sentiment ranking is described in the paper: P. Kralj Novak, J. Smailović, B. Sluban, I. Mozetič, Sentiment of Emojis, submitted; arXiv preprint, [http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07761](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07761), 2015.
